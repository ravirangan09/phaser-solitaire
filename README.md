# Phaser Solitaire
This is just an exercise on building Solitaire/Klondike using the excellent Phaser Game engine. 
My first foray into game programming. Also, did a complete rewite to a more Object oriented methodology, which is easier for the reader. See commit history on how I started with procedural and then migrated to object oriented code.

## Install
The standard `yarn install` for nodejs

`yarn build` for building production. Need a web server to host production

Uses `parcel` builder
